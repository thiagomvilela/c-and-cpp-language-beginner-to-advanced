<h1 align="center">Complete C and C++ Language Course - Beginner to Advanced</h1>

## Description

A course for those who have always dreamed of becoming a programmer, but have never programmed a single line.

The C language is a great language to learn, because most of the high-level languages used today were made based on C, that is, when learning C you will be very easy to learn any other language!

In this course you will learn to create programs with the features:

Course Review "Learn C and C++ - Fundamentals of Logic Programming"

- Understand the difference between High Level X Low Level
- Understand the difference between Programming X Coding
- Define, Traverse, and Access Arrays
- Define, Traverse, and Access Vectors
- Define Constants
- Develop Menus
- Create repeating loops (While, For)
- Use Logical Connectors (AND, OR, NOT)
- Working with Simple or Compound Conditionals (IF, Switch Case)
- do math operations
- Use different types of variables (Int, Float, Char, Boolean)

ESSENTIAL

- Review on Defining and Printing Variables
- Review of Vectors, Matrices and Loops
- how to use pointers
- How to clean the screen
- Use returnless functions
- Use return functions (Integers, Characters, Booleans)
- Using functions with single and multiple parameters passing
- Using functions with passing parameters with pointers
- Dynamic allocation of Vectors and Matrices
- Build structures (Structs)
- Reading and Writing to External Files

CREATION OF GAMES

- Creation of Tic-Tac-Tac-Toe, Naval Battle and Hangman
- Creation of Boards
- Random Placement
- Creation of Masks
- Feedback Messages
- Modify Color in Terminal
- Play in Doubles

DATA STRUCTURES
- Simple Search
- Binary Search
- Queue Operations
- Stack Operations
- bubble sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- quick sort
- shell sort
- merge sort

EXTRA COURSE

At the end, you can still take an extra course in Agile Project Management with Scrum, so you can work with bigger projects, manage teams and stand out in the job market!

In addition, you will have individual support to answer your questions and answer questionnaires to reinforce your knowledge.

At the end of the course you will receive a certificate.

This course is for beginners, even if they have NEVER PROGRAMMED IN THEIR LIFE.
